# UnSupervised Learning
## What is UnSupervised Learning
* Working with data with No Labels or Explanation of Data
* Needs for UnSupervised Learning
    * Compression
    * Feature Grading
    * GANs
    * Exploratory Data Analysis
## Auto Encoders
* Auto Enders Components (Encoders, and Decoders)
* Error Function = X - Dec(Enc(X))
* Dimensionality Reduction
* Deep Auto Encoders
* Problem Specific Encoders
# More AutoEncoders
## Applications
* Adding L1 Regularization to Activations to Remove irrelevant Features
* DropOut Layers
* De-noising Auto Encoders
* Pre-training
## Image Applications of AutoEncoders
* t-SNE Method for Feature Reduction
* Image Morphing
# Word Embedding
## NLP Primer
* Definitions of NLP
* Word Bags and Text Classifications
* Word Embedding
## Word Embedding
* Sparse Vectors Products (One Hot Vector)
* Word2Vec - (CBOW & Skip-Gram)
* Word Algebra
* SoftMax Problem and Alternatives
# GANs
## GANs 101
## GANs
* Generator and Discriminator
* Noise + Params -> Generator NN -> Fake Image
* Image (Fake or Real) -> Discriminator NN -> P(fake|Image)
* Trainable Networks
* Learning to Sample
## Applications of GANs
* Adversarial Approach
* Style Transfer
